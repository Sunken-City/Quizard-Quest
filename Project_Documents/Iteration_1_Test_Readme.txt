Quizard Quest Iteration 1 Test Instructions:

Hi there! Thank you very much for testing our game (Or lack thereof, at this point)!







Idea behind the game:

Quizard Quest is a flashcard-based adventure game, which uses risk and reward to gamify your studying experience!
Users create flashcards online, and then use those cards to create decks of flash cards which they can use to play various game modes.
We haven't started development of the game frontend yet, but as of now, you can create cards and add them to decks.





Areas to focus testing on:

1. Card creation: Can you create cards easily and robustly? Are there any values that will cause an error?

2. Website flow: Are all of the pages leading to the correct places? Are there certain values that you can fill in that break the code, or take you out of CSS'd pages for error messages?

3. Deck Creation: Are there any problems with deck creation and viewing? Can you do things like double add cards, or have error-returning values?








Just a few quick pointers to help you out:

1. The server is located at http://54.200.82.84/Quizard-Quest/Website/

2. There are no test accounts or admin accounts premade as of yet, but feel free to make your own!

3. Please try your hardest to break everything! The more bugs you find, the less users will!
