Quizard-Quest
=============

A project created by cd msc/, Quizard Quest is a web and Android application based on making studying fun. By taking the common practice of creating flashcards and gamifying it, we're able to tap into the risk and reward system of video games and bring that to one of the most tedious exercises.
